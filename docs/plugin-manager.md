## Managing Plugins with Plugify

The plugin manager in Plugify plays a crucial role in handling the loading, initialization, and termination of plugins. Here's how you can control the plugin manager effectively:

### Initializing the Plugin Manager

Initialize the plugin manager after a successful initialization of the package manager. The plugin manager relies on information about local packages obtained from the package manager:

```cpp
// Example: Initializing the Plugin Manager
auto pluginManager = plugifyProvider.GetPluginManager();
if (pluginManager.Initialize()) {
    // Perform plugin management operations
    // ...
} else {
    // Handle plugin manager initialization failure
    // ...
}
```

### Loading and Unloading Plugins

The plugin manager in Plugify has specific characteristics regarding loading and unloading:

- **Initialization:**
    - The plugin manager can be initialized only if the package manager initialization was successful.

- **Load and Unload Operations:**
    - The plugin manager does not support the individual loading and unloading of plugins after initialization.
    - To update the plugins, unload the entire plugin manager and initialize it again.

### Starting and Ending Plugins

- **Initialization Order:**
    - During initialization, the plugin manager sorts plugins by dependencies using topological sorting to ensure correct initialization order.

- **Startup and Termination:**
    - Plugins are started after initialization, ensuring a smooth startup sequence.
    - When terminating the plugin manager, it ends plugins in reverse order of loading.
